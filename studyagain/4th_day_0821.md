# Greedy Algorithm



  Greedy algorithm is simple but strong algorithm to solve the problem. As you can know in the name, when it encounters a problem, it solves emptyheadedly and greedily. In other words, this algorithm chooses the best in present situation. Greedy algorithm chooses the best in every situation without concerning about the effect of choice. 

So greedy algorithm is really good at problems like 'in order from largest to smallest'. This kind of problem needs sorting algorithm, too.

 

Greedy algorithm cannot be used in every problem. So when we use greedy algorithm, we need to verify that it is right to solve it. Greedy algorithm is the easiest way to think but verifying is hard since we have to think of all kind of possible counterexample.
