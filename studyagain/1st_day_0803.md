## 1. Using Git 

git init

git add 

git add . 

git config --global user.email "tjdgns1284@gmail.com"

git config --global user.name "tom"

git commit -m "message"

git log

git remote add origin https://github.com/tjdgns1284/nakacuwoo.git  

(whatever it is okay to use instead of origin. it is name for the remote repository)

git push -u origin master (1st time )

git push



git clone 

git pull





## 2. Variables 

Variabele is a box which is saving a specific data. The name of a box is "identifier", which is case sensitive and no length limit. First digit couldn't be number and some words which are called keyword, can't be used as an identifier.

```python
import keyword
print (keyword.kwlist)
-> ['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']
```

if you use built-in functions as an identifiler, it may cause some errors.

###  Assignment Operator `=`

`=` gives a data to a variable. Using function `type()`, we can see the type of data which is lying in the variable. Using function `id()`, we will see the address of the variable

### Data type

number

* int

  * integer, no length limit
  * basically decimal, but also it can be binary, octal, hexadecimal.

  ```python
  binary_number = 0b10
  print(binary_number)
  2
  octal_number = 0o10
  print(octal_number)
  8
  hexadecimal_number = 0x10
  print(hexadecimal_number)
  16
  ```

* float

  * real number
  * In calculating float type data, there are some exceptions.

* ```python
  3.5 - 3.2 == 0.3 
  False 
  #so we need to solve this problem, we have to use round function
  round(3.5 - 3.2, 2)
  #the first argument is float data, the second one is the place which is rounded off
  # so the answer for that is 0.3 which is different to 0.3000000...
  #also using epsilon or math, it is possible
  import sys
  a = 3.5-3.2
  b = 0.3
  abs(a-b)<= sys.float_info.epsilon
  => True
  ####
  import math 
  math.isclose(a,b)
  => True
  ```

* complex

  * Complex number, like 3+4j

* ```python
  
  b = complex('3+4j')
  type(b)
  complex
  # you cannot use space in front of (or in rear of) the operator
  c = complex(' 3 + 4j')
  
  error
  ```



### String

Basically it is expressed by using `'`, `"` 

To save many lines in one variable, we can use `''' '''` , `""" """`

`input()` function returns string data. To use the input as a number, we have to use `int()` function

```python
number = input('number plz? : ') 
#5
print(number * 2)
#55
num=int(number)
print(num * 2)
#10
one_line = "I want to go IT company"
many_lines = """
What I have to study is Coding, algorithm and English. 
I don't know which is the most important thing but apperanticing is important not only for my career, also for my whole life. 
"""
```

 

Using \ (escape sequence)

`\n`  : changing line 

`\t` : tapping

`\r` : carriage return

`\n`: line feed 

`\0` :  NULL

`\\` : \ in str 

`\'` : '  in str 

`\"`: "  in str





### Interpolation (formating)

We really need to print some line which includes other variables. To do this, There are 3 ways.(or more)



* % formatting
* .format()
* f - string

```python
name = 'Tom'
print('my name is %s' % name)
nationality = 'Korea'
print('my name is {}, I live in {}'.format(name, nationality))
print(f'my name is {name}, I live in {nationality}')
```



### Boolean

There is two boolean type data in python(True, False)

Except several things, almost every data is True

```python
0, 0.0, (), {} , [], '', None, False
```

Those things are False.

True is inted by int(), it is 1.

False is 0.

This is called Type conversion

### None 

None is nothing to record, and it is also data type.(NoneType)





### Type conversion

There are two conversions in python.

one is implicit, the other is explicit

Implicit is automatically done in python

like int(True) = 1 , int + complex = complex

Explicit is conversing type by function

like int(), str(), float(), list()
