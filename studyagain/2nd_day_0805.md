## Operator

### Arithmetic Operator

|  +   |   plus    |
| :--: | :-------: |
|  -   |   minus   |
|  *   | multiply  |
|  /   |  divide   |
|  //  | quotient  |
|  %   | remainder |
|  **  |   power   |

Divide always returns float type data



### Relational Operator

|   <    |        Under        |
| :----: | :-----------------: |
|   <=   |   Under or equal    |
|   >    |        Over         |
|   >=   |    Over or equal    |
|   ==   |        Equal        |
|   !=   |      Not equal      |
|   is   |   Is same Address   |
| is not | Is not same address |



### Logical Operator

| A and B |  if A,B are True => true  |
| :-----: | :-----------------------: |
| A or B  | if A,B are false => false |
|  not A  |   if A is true => false   |

```python
print(True and True) 
print(True and False)
print(False and True)
print(False and False)
print(True or True) 
print(True or False)
print(False or True)
print(False or False)
```

For logical operator and, if the first one (A in the example above) is False, whether B is true or not, A and B is False. The result is not always True or False.

 ```python
vowels = 'aeiou'
print('a' and 'b')
# result is 'b' since python will check the second one
print(False and 'b')
#False, the First one is False, python doesn't need to check the second
print('a' or 'b')
# 'a' since 'a' is True 
print(False or 'b')
# 'b'  

print(('c' or 'e') in vowels)
# False  since ('c' or 'e') is 'c'
 ```



### Assignment Operator 

> Those operators are frequently used in Loop

| a += b  | a= a+b  |
| :-----: | :-----: |
| a -= b  | a= a-b  |
| a *= b  | a= a*b  |
| a /= b  | a= a/b  |
| a //= b | a= a//b |
| a %= b  | a= a%b  |
| a **=b  | a= a**b |



## List

List is a sequential container, list is expressed by `[]` or `list()`  

We can use value in a list by `list[i]`

```python
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
numbers[0]
numbers= numbers + [11]
print(numbers)
#[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
```

## Conditional/ Control/ Loop

### If  conditional 

If needs a condition which is determined as True or False.

```python
is_christmas = input('input the date ex)12/24 : ')
if (is_christmas == '12/25') : 
  print("Marry Christmas")
else: 
  print("It is not Christmas")

```

condition is true, python will execute the lines after`:`.

false will trigger the lines after `else:`

We can use many conditions by using `elif`. elif and else are optional

#### we need to use 4 spaces (or One tap) 



#### Conditional Express

```python
value = num if num >= 0 else -num 
# This equals to
if num>= 0 :
    value = num 
else : 
    value = -num
```



## Loop

### For

For will traverse a sequence(list, string, range ...) or a iterable things

```python
for a in ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']:
  print(a)
```

`enumerate()` will make index for the sequence

```python
for idx, menu in enumerate(lunch) : 
  print(idx)
  print(menu)
```



### While

While will execute the lines after `:`  'while' condition is True

```python
a=0
while a<5 :
  print(a)
  a += 1
# 0 1 2 3 4
```

 

### Loop control (`break`, `continue`, `for-else`)

#### `break`

> End the loop (for or while )

#### `continue`

> codes after continue is skipped and start the loop again in the next one  

#### `for-else`

> if the loop is over because  sequence is over, codes after else will be executed.
>
> if the loop is over by break, it will not



```python
for i in range(10):
    if i>=5:
        break
    print(i)
# 0 1 2 3 4



ages = [10, 23, 8, 30, 25, 31]
for age in ages : 
  if age < 20: 
    continue
  
  print(f'{age} years old is an adult.')
'''
23 years old is an adult.
30 years old is an adult.
25 years old is an adult.
31 years old is an adult.
'''

numbers = [1, 5, 10]
for number in numbers : 
  print(number)
  if number == 3 : 
    print('we find 3!')
    break
else : 
  print('we traverse the whole list') 
'''
1
5
10
we traverse the whole list
'''


numbers = [1, 5, 10]
for number in numbers : 
  print(number)
  if number == 5 : 
    print('we find 5!')
    break
else : 
  print('we traverse the whole list') 

'''
1
5
we find 5!
'''




```





## Dictionary

```python
{Key1:Value1, Key2:Value2, Key3:Value3, ...}
```

It is made by `{}` or `dict()`

key needs to be an immutable data (string, integer, float, tuple, range, boolean)

Value can be anything

dictionary.keys() will check key

dictionary.values() will check values

dictionary.items() will check both



###  Set

Set is not sequential, and there is no overlapped value in set

set is expressed by `set()` 

```python
set_a = {1,2,3}
set_b = {3,6,9}
print(set_a - set_b) #difference
print(set_a | set_b) #union
print(set_a & set_b) #intersection


my_list = [1,5,1,2,1,1,3,8]
my_set = set(my_list)
print(my_set)
# 1 5 2 3 8


```



### Mutable? Immutable?

A single data is immutable 

i.g) 

number, string, bool



containers except `tuple`, `range`, `frozenset` are mutable data
